### Initial findings

From the above chart we can extrapulate:

- Our data set has the following dates - Start date: 2020-01-22 / End Date: 2021-10-14
- There were disproportionate hospitalisations at the start of the data set
- Hospitilisations don't mimic cases. We should look into this more
- Deats are relatively low
- Recvoered cases closley follow reported cases but suddenly fall off in a sharp drop. This should be looked into further
