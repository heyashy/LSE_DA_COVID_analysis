# Initial findings

<p>Our data set contains time-series data from 2020-01-22 until 2021-10-15. In the above example we examined the case, death, recovery and hospitalisation data fro Gibralter. From the above chart we can extrapulate:</p>

- There were disproportionate hospitalisations at the start of the data set
- Hospitalisations don't mimic cases. We should look into this more
- Deats are relatively low
- Recvoered cases closley follow reported cases but suddenly fall off in a sharp drop. This should be looked into further

<p>We may have possible errors and missing information in our data that would need to be examined further. This includes:</p>

- Mismatch of hospitalisations to case numbers
- Sudden drop in recovered data

<p>Things to look at include:</p>
- Why there was a sudden spike of cases mid way through the data set
- Hospitalisations exceed case numbers several times and actually dropped to nearlly zero at the peak of the cases
